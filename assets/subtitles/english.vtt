00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.080
First of all, thank you so much for being here 
with us. I want to ask you a few questions.  

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.920
First of all, tell me a little bit about 
the relationship you have with yourself?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.600
With myself before the accident?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.000
Both.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.240
Both. Who was on social media? 
Who's using Facebook? Everyone.  

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.960
Have you ever put your relationship status 
complicated? My relationship with myself,  

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:04.160
before I was here was so complicated. It 
was all about people. It was never about me.  

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.000
There was no me anywhere. You see people's 
pleaser. The person who just wants to make  

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.280
everyone happy knowing that it's not worth it. 
You just keep doing it. Keep doing it. And yes,  

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.280
your relationship eventually with 
yourself becomes complicated.  

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.520
And then now, I don't know where there are people 
around me or not, but I me now. I'm more me now.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.080
That's so nice. What advice would 
you give to your younger self?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.960
To my younger self? Interesting question! 
Well, I'll just make her sit next to me  

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.480
and very nicely, I'll tell her. Don't invest 
yourself in the wrong people. Because when you  

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.800
invest yourself in the wrong people, they 
break you into pieces, they torn you apart  

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.320
in such a way that it takes years 
and years to get back together.  

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.480
And also, I will tell her that while you 
are busy making amazing plans in your life,  

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.040
my dear, prepare yourself for worse. Because 
life is so unpredictable. Just be prepared.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.480
One of my philosophies in life is, is that there 
are three steps in order to repair your life.  

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.960
First of all, is to change your personal 
story, then your daily rituals, and then  

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.320
the people, you surround yourself. I 
believe so much in these. So tell me,  

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.680
how important is to surround 
yourself with the right people?

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.320
Time is a beautiful teacher. It filters out 
the extras from your life, including people.  

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.760
Being in the wheelchair in 12 years, 
I've had three categories of people.  

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.880
Number one category is of the people who see 
you in the misery in pain and the backoff,  

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.760
they're like we are gone. We can't handle 
it. I respect them for their honesty.  

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.000
Then there is another category of the people 
who are not there with you, but they just want  

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.240
to cling on with you all the time. They're so 
weak, that they try to stay in your shadow.  

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.120
Liberate yourself from those people, 
because they are toxic for you.  

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.320
Don't let them cling on to you 
because they're not there to help you,  

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:59.280
liberate them, liberate yourself, and then there 
is the third category. These beautiful people who  

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.080
are so selfless, that when they see you in pain, 
they stand next to you. They've got your back.  

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.280
They don't share the limelight. 
They're just there for you.  

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.640
These are your people value them. So yes, 
there are three categories of people try  

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.760
to surround yourself with those who 
are real, and you will feel real.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.320
What about jealousy?
  

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.360
What about?
 
About jealousy.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:38.880
Jealousy? I pity them. I pity those who see their 
failure in your success. You know, these critics,  

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.560
they were once dreamers. They just wanted to 
achieve something that today you have, but they  

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:55.840
gave up and they started becoming jealous of you. 
Pray for them because they're in a lot of pain.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.480
One of the things that I see usually when 
I do therapy, a lot of women, they prefer  

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:13.280
to stay in a miserable relationship instead of 
get out. The fear of being alone is greater.  

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.440
So would you give some advice to these women?
  

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.440
We all tend to invest ourselves 
in relationships. And as I said,  

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.360
if you are doing something right, but the 
wrong person, nothing good will turn out,  

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.800
and deep inside, we were quite intuitive. 
We know that it's not going anywhere.  

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.040
It's okay to be on your own. You are stronger 
than you think. Don't worry about that,  

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.240
and wait for the right person. Let the right 
person come to you. There's no rush. Are you in  

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.800
a good relationship with yourself? Do you love 
your own company? If you're miserable alone,  

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.680
I'm sorry, your partner will be miserable 
with you. So we need to understand  

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.800
that we need to love our own company, only 
then people will love to enjoy our company too.  

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.080
And don't rush. Wait for the right person. 
Because if it's meant to be, it will be.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:31.280
One of the things I usually say is that your 
relationships reflect your self relationships. So  

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.120
the most important thing is to look within to 
fix the most important relationship that is  

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:45.440
the relationship you have with yourself. Muniba, I 
want to ask you, how do you want to be remembered?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.320
Such a beautiful question.  

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.960
I want to be remembered as an empath. Somebody 
who just didn't say that I feel your pain,  

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.320
but I want people to see that when I say this I 
mean it. And as far as my life story is concerned,  

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.520
I don't know how my story will 
end. Maybe it will never end,  

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.840
but yes, nowhere in my text, the 
world will ever read I gave up.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.760
Apart from art, What kept you going in life?

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.560
I think all sorts of art kept me going. I 
love music. I used to sing. I still sing  

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:36.720
lullabies for my son, and just like painting 
art music is so therapeutic. So I love music.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:43.840
I don't know if the crowd would love that. 
If it's okay with you, would you mind sing  

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.400
something for us? Just to listen to your voice.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:01.760
Have you watched Tangled? Tangled Rapunzel her 
journey how she comes out of confinement for the  

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:09.680
first time. She goes out and sees the world awaits 
her. You know what that song "I see the light"  

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.280
it reminds me of the times when I was bedridden,  

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:23.520
and I used to hear the kids playing outside. 
I couldn't see it. I used to hear thunderclap  

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:31.760
I couldn't see the storms. I used to hear the 
rain falling on the ground. I couldn't see it,  

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.280
and I missed it. But when I sat in the 
wheelchair I stepped out went close to nature  

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.160
everything's changed. So this beautiful song I see 
the light. Probably something I'd like to sing.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.000
"All those days watching from the windows

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.040
All those years outside looking in

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.040
All that time never even knowing

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.680
Just how blind I've been

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.080
Now I'm here blinking in the starlight

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.560
Now I'm here suddenly I see

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.680
Standing here it's oh so clear

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.960
I'm where I'm meant to be

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.840
And at last, I see the light

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.200
And it's like the fog has lifted

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:37.040
And at last, I see the light

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.040
...the sky is new

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:49.840
And it's warm and real and bright...

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.520
And the world has somehow shifted

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.160
All at once, everything looks different.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.379
Now that I see you.”

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:05.760
God bless you!

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.301
Thank you so much.
Antonio...

00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:07.363
Here comes the chief guest.
He's so adorable! Oh my god! 

00:10:07.363 --> 00:10:09.600
Oh, God bless you.
Thank you so much.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.560
Thank you so much.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:10.880
Thank you.
